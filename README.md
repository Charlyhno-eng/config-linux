# linux-mint-xfce-config

This is my Linux Mint XFCE setup with Polybar — an ultra-lightweight configuration that uses around 1.05 GB of RAM when idle, which is impressively low. I also included some custom Conky widgets I coded myself in one of the folders, although I’m currently not using them.

## Zed Editor Configuration

For development, I use the Zed IDE — a fast and powerful code editor written in Rust. It’s designed for performance and responsiveness, making it perfect for both lightweight coding and large projects. Zed also supports integration with AI tools, allowing you to add your own API keys for an enhanced development experience.

- **AI :** `Gemini-2.0-flash`
- **AI extensions :** Super Maven

## Terminal Tools

These are the terminal tools I use regularly, chosen for their performance, usability, and modern features : I run the Kitty terminal with Oh My Zsh and the Powerlevel10k theme, which provide a fast, customizable, and visually appealing shell experience.

- **zsh**
  A powerful and extensible shell that replaces Bash. Offers advanced autocompletion, globbing, and theming (commonly used with Oh My Zsh or Prezto).

- **LazyDocker**
  A simple terminal UI for Docker and Docker Compose. Allows you to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks with a clean and interactive interface, without memorizing CLI commands.

- **batcat** (aka `bat`)
  A cat clone with syntax highlighting, Git integration, and line numbers. Useful for reading code or config files directly from the terminal with style.

- **mpv**
  A versatile media player for audio and video. Often used in the terminal with simple commands, supports many formats and configurations.

- **cava**
  Console-based Audio Visualizer for ALSA or PulseAudio. Displays real-time audio spectrum bars in the terminal. Often used with `mpv` or music players.

- **zoxide**
  A smarter `cd` command that learns your directory habits. Quickly jump to frequently or recently visited folders using just parts of their names.
